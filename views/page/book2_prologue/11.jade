		"Be that as it may, my lord," Maester Cressen said gently. "Great wrongs have been done you, but the past is dust.
		The future may yet be won if you join with the Starks. There are others you might sound out as well. What of Lady Arryn?
		If the queen murdered her husband, surely she will want justice for him. She has a young son, Jon Arryn's heir. If you
		were to betroth Shireen to him-"
		"The boy is weak and sickly," Lord Stannis objected. "Even his father saw how it was, when he asked me to foster
		him on Dragonstone. Service as a page might have done him good, but that damnable Lannister woman had Lord Arryn
		poisoned before it could be done, and now Lysa hides him in the Eyrie. She'll never part with the boy, I promise you
		that. "
		"Then you must send Shireen to the Eyrie," the maester ‘ urged. "Dragonstone is a grim home for a child. Let her
		fool go with her, so she will have a familiar face about her."
		"Familiar and hideous." Stannis furrowed his brow in thought. "Still... perhaps it is worth the trying..."
		"Must the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms beg for help from widow women and usurpers?" a woman's voice asked
		sharply.
		Maester Cressen turned ‘ and bowed his head. "My lady," he said, chagrined that he had not heard her enter.
		Lord Stannis scowled. "I do not beg. Of anyone. Mind you remember that, woman."
		"I am pleased to hear it, my lord." Lady Selyse was as tall as her husband, thin of body and thin of face, with
		prominent ears, a sharp nose, and the faintest hint of a mustache on her upper lip. She plucked it daily and cursed it
		regularly, yet it never failed to return. Her eyes were pale, her mouth stern, her voice a whip. She cracked it now.
		"Lady Arryn owes you her allegiance, as do the Starks, your brother Renly, and all the rest. You are their one true
		king. It would not be fitting to plead and bargain with them for what is rightfully yours by the grace of god."
		God, she said, not gods. The red woman had won her, heart and soul, turning her from the gods of the Seven Kingdoms,
		both old and new, to worship the one they called the Lord of Light.
		"Your god can keep his grace," said Lord Stannis, who did not share his wife's fervent new faith. "It's swords
		I need, not blessings. Do you have an army hidden somewhere that you've not told me of?" There was no affection in
		his tone. Stannis had always been uncomfortable around women, even his own wife. When he had gone to King's Landing to
		sit on Robert's council, he had left Selyse on Dragonstone with their daughter. His letters had been few, his visits
		fewer; he did his duty in the marriage bed once or twice a year, but took no joy in it, and the sons he had once hoped
		for had never come.
		"My brothers and uncles and cousins have armies," she told him. "House Florent will rally to your banner."
		"House Florent can field two thousand swords at best." It was said that Stannis knew the strength of every house in
		the Seven Kingdoms. "And you have a deal more faith in your brothers and uncles than I do, my lady. The Florent lands
		lie too close to Highgarden for your lord uncle to risk Mace Tyrell's wrath."
