		"Maester," said Lady Melisandre, her deep voice flavored with the music of the jade Sea. "You ought take more
		care." As ever, she wore red head to heel, a long loose gown of flowing silk as bright as fire, with dagged sleeves
		and deep slashes in the bodice that showed glimpses of a darker bloodred fabric beneath. Around her throat was a red
		gold choker tighter than any maester's chain, ornamented with a single great ruby.
		Her hair was not the orange or strawberry color of common red-haired men, but a deep burnished copper that shone in the
		light of the torches. Even her eyes were red... but her skin was smooth and white, unblemished, pale as cream. Slender
		she was, graceful, taller than most knights, with full breasts and narrow waist and a heart-shaped face. Men's eyes
		that once found her did not quickly look away, not even a maester's eyes. Many called her beautiful. She was not
		beautiful. She was red, and terrible, and red.
		"I... thank you, my lady."
		"A man your age must look to where he steps," Melisandre said courteously. "The night is dark and full of
		terrors."
		He knew the phrase, some prayer of her faith. It makes no matter, I have a faith of my own. "Only children fear the
		dark," he told her. Yet even as he said the words, he heard Patchface take up his song again. "The shadows come to
		dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord. "
		"Now here is a riddle," Melisandre said. "A clever fool and a foolish wise man." Bending, she picked up
		Patchface's helm from where it had fallen and set it on Cressen's head. The cowbells rang softly as the tin bucket
		slid down over his ears. "A crown to match your chain, Lord Maester," she announced. All around them, men were
		laughing.
		Cressen pressed his lips together and fought to still his rage. She thought he was feeble and helpless, but she would
		learn otherwise before the night was done. Old he might be, yet he was still a maester of the Citadel. "I need no
		crown but truth," he told her, removing the fool's helm from his head.
		"There are truths in this world that are not taught at Oldtown." Melisandre turned from him in a swirl of red silk
		and made her way back to the high table, where King Stannis and his queen were seated. Cressen handed the antlered tin
		bucket back to Patchface, and made to follow.
		Maester Pylos sat in his place.
		The old man could only stop and stare. "Maester Pylos," he said at last. "You... you did not wake me."
		"His Grace commanded me to let you rest." Pylos had at least the grace to blush. "He told me you were not needed
		here."
		Cressen looked over the knights and captains and lords sitting silent. Lord Celtigar, aged and sour, wore a mantle
		patterned with red crabs picked out in garnets. Handsome Lord Velaryon chose sea-green silk, the white gold seahorse at
		his throat matching his long fair hair. Lord Bar Emmon, that plump boy of fourteen, was swathed in purple velvet trimmed
		with white seal, Ser Axell Florent remained homely even in russet and fox fur, pious Lord Sunglass wore moonstones at
		throat and wrist and finger, and the Lysene captain Salladhor Saan was a sunburst of scarlet
