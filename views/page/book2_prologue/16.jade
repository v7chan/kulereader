		satin, gold, and jewels. Only Ser Davos dressed simply, in brown doublet and green wool mantle, and only Ser Davos met
		his gaze, with pity in his eyes.
		"You are too ill and too confused to be of use to me, old man." It sounded so like Lord Stannis's voice, but it
		could not be, it could not. "Pylos will counsel me henceforth. Already he works with the ravens, since you can no
		longer climb to the rookery. I will not have you kill yourself in my service."
		Maester Cressen blinked. Stannis, my lord, my sad sullen boy, son I never had, you must not do this, don't you know
		how I have cared for you, lived for you, loved you despite all? Yes, loved you, better than Robert even, or Renly, for
		you were the one unloved, the one who needed me most. Yet all he said was, "As you command, my lord, but... but I am
		hungry. Might not I have a place at your table?" At your side, I belong at your side...
		Ser Davos rose from the bench. "I should be honored if the maester would sit here beside me, Your Grace."
		"As you will." Lord Stannis turned away to say something to Melisandre, who had seated herself at his right hand, in
		the place of high honor. Lady Selyse was on his left, flashing a smile as bright and brittle as her jewels.
		Too far, Cressen thought dully, looking at where Ser Davos was seated. Half of the lords bannermen were between the
		smuggler and the high table. I must be closer to her if I am to get the strangler into her cup, yet how?
		Patchface was capering about as the maester made his slow way around the table to Davos Seaworth. "Here we eat
		fish," the fool declared happily, waving a cod about like a scepter. "Under the sea, the fish eat us. I know, I
		know, oh, oh, oh."
		Ser Davos moved aside to make room on the bench. "We all should be in motley tonight," he said gloomily as Cressen
		seated himself, "for this is fool's business we're about. The red woman has seen victory in her flames, so Stannis
		means to press his claim, no matter what the numbers. Before she's done we're all like to see what Patchface saw, I
		fear the bottom of the sea."
		Cressen slid his hands up into his sleeves as if for warmth. His fingers found the hard lumps the crystals made in the
		wool. "Lord Stannis."
		Stannis turned from the red woman, but it was Lady Selyse who replied. "King Stannis. You forget yourself,
		Maester."
		"He is old, his mind wanders," the king told her gruffly. "What is it, Cressen? Speak your mind."
		"As you intend to sail, it is vital that you make common cause with Lord Stark and Lady Arryn...
		"I make common cause with no one," Stannis Baratheon said.
		"No more than light makes common cause with darkness." Lady Selyse took his hand.
		Stannis nodded. "The Starks seek to steal half my kingdom, even as the Lannisters have stolen
		my throne and my own sweet brother the swords and service and strongholds that are mine by rights. They are all
		usurpers, and they are all my enemies."
