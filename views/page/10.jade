		my brother decided to steal my crown? What counsel did your colleague offer to this traitor blood of mine?"
		"It would surprise me if Lord Renly sought counsel, Your Grace." The youngest of Lord Steffon’s three sons had
		grown into a man bold but heedless, who acted from impulse rather than calculation. In that, as in so much else, Renly
		was like his brother Robert, and utterly unlike Stannis.
		"Your Grace," Stannis repeated bitterly. "You mock me with a king’s style, yet what am I king of? Dragonstone
		and a few rocks in the narrow sea, there is my kingdom." He descended the steps of his chair to stand before the
		table, his shadow falling across the mouth of the Blackwater Rush and the painted forest where King’s Landing now
		stood. There he stood, brooding over the realm he sought to claim, so near at hand and yet so far away. "Tonight I am
		to sup with my lords bannermen, such as they are. Celtigar, Velaryon, Bar Emmon, the whole paltry lot of them. A poor
		crop, if truth be told, but they are what my brothers have left me. That Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan will be there with
		the latest tally of what I owe him, and Morosh the Myrman will caution me with talk of tides and autumn gales, while
		Lord Sunglass mutters piously of the will of the Seven. Celtigar will want to know which storm lords are joining us.
		Velaryon will threaten to take his levies home unless we strike at once. What am I to tell them? What must I do now?"
		"Your true enemies are the Lannisters, my lord," Maester Cressen answered. "If you and your brother were to make
		common cause against them-"
		"I will not treat with Renly," Stannis answered in a tone that brooked no argument. "Not while he calls himself a
		king."
		"Not Renly, then," the maester yielded. His lord was stubborn and proud; when he had set his mind, there was no
		changing it. "Others might serve your needs as well. Eddard Stark’s son has been proclaimed King in the North, with
		all the power of Winterfell and Riverrun behind him."
		"A green boy," said Stannis, "and another false king. Am I to accept a broken realm?"
		"Surely half a kingdom is better than none," Cressen said, "and if you help the boy avenge his father’s
		murder-"
		"Why should I avenge Eddard Stark? The man was nothing to me. Oh, Robert loved him, to be sure. Loved him as a
		brother, how often did I hear that? I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would never have known it by the way he
		treated me. I held Storm’s End for him, watching good men starve while Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne feasted within
		sight of my walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He thanked Stark, for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and
		radishes. I built a fleet at Robert’s command, took Dragonstone in his name. Did he take my hand and say, Well done,
		brother, whatever should I do without you? No, he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as
		if I could have stopped it. I sat on his council for fifteen years, helping Jon Arryn rule his realm while Robert drank
		and whored, but when Jon died, did my brother name me his Hand? No, he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark,
		and offered him the honor. And small good it did either of them. "
