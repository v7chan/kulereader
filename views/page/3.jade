    #[span.name.ned "That is the only time a man can be brave,"] his father told him. #[span.name.ned "Do you understand why I did it?"] 
    #[span.name.bran "He was a wildling," Bran] said. #[span.name.bran "They carry off women and sell them to the Others."] His lord father smiled. 
    <span class='name ned'>"Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night's Watch. No man is
        more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime,
        no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it."</span>
    #[span.name.bran Bran] had no answer for that. #[span.name.bran "King Robert has a headsman,"] he said, uncertainly. #[span.name.ned "He does,"] his father
    admitted. <span class='name ned'>"As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men
        still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should
        swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final
        words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die." "One day, Bran, you
    will be Robb's bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to
    you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who
    hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is."</span> 
    That was when #[span.name.jon Jon] reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at them. 
    #[span.name.jon "Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!"] Then he was gone again. #[span.name.jory Jory] rode up beside them. 
    #[span.name.jory "Trouble, my lord?"] #[span.name.ned "Beyond a doubt,"] his lord father said.
    #[span.name.ned "Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now."] He sent his horse into a trot. #[span.name.jory Jory] and #[span.name.bran Bran] and
    the rest came after. They found #[span.name.robb Robb] on the riverbank north of the bridge, with #[span.name.jon Jon] still mounted beside him.
    The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. #[span.name.robb Robb] stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so the
    sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices.
    The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven
    ground. #[span.name.jory Jory Cassel] and #[span.name.theon Theon Greyjoy] were the first to reach the boys. #[span.name.theon Greyjoy] was laughing and joking as he
    rode. #[span.name.bran Bran] heard the breath go out of him. #[span.name.bran "Gods!"] he exclaimed, struggling to keep control of his horse as he
    reached for his sword. #[span.name.jory Jory&#39;s] sword was already out. #[span.name.jory "Robb, get away from it!"] he called as his horse reared
    under him. #[span.name.robb Robb] grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. #[span.name.robb "She can't hurt you,"] he said. 
    #[span.name.robb "She's dead, Jory."] #[span.name.bran Bran] was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them
    dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. #[span.name.bran Bran] jumped off and ran. By then #[span.name.jon Jon], #[span.name.jory Jory], and #[span.name.theon Theon Greyjoy]
    had all dismounted as well. #[span.name.theon "What in the seven hells is it?" Greyjoy] was saying. #[span.name.robb "A wolf," Robb] told him. 
    #[span.name.theon "A freak," Greyjoy] said. #[span.name.theon "Look at the size of it."]
