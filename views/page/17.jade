		I have lost him, Cressen thought, despairing. If only he could somehow approach Melisandre unseen... he needed but an
		instant’s access to her cup. "You are the rightful heir to your brother Robert, the true Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
		and King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men," he said desperately, "but even so, you cannot hope to
		triumph without allies."
		"He has an ally," Lady Selyse said. "Whllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow."
		"Gods make uncertain allies at best," the old man insisted, "and that one has no power here."
		"You think not?" The ruby at Melisandre’s throat caught the light as she turned her head, and for an instant it
		seemed to glow bright as the comet. "If you will speak such folly, Maester, you ought to wear your crown again."
		"Yes," Lady Selyse agreed. "Patches’s helm. It suits you well, old man. Put it on again, I command you."
		"Under the sea, no one wears hats," Patchface said. "I know, I know, oh, oh, oh."
		Lord Stannis’s eyes were shadowed beneath his heavy brow, his mouth tight as his jaw worked silently. He always ground
		his teeth when he was angry. "Fool," he growled at last, "my lady wife commands. Give Cressen your helm."
		No, the old maester thought, this is not you, not your way, you were always just, always hard yet never cruel, never,
		you did not understand mockery, no more than you understood laughter.
		Patchface danced closer, his cowbells ringing, clang-a-lang, ding-ding, clink-clank-clink-clank. The maester sat silent
		while the fool set the antlered bucket on his brow. Cressen bowed his head beneath the weight. His bells clanged.
		"Perhaps he ought sing his counsel henceforth," Lady Selyse said.
		"You go too far, woman," Lord Stannis said. "He is an old man, and he’s served me well."
		And I will serve you to the last, my sweet lord, my poor lonely son, Cressen thought, for suddenly he saw the way. Ser
		Davos’s cup was before him, still half-full of sour red. He found a hard flake of crystal in his sleeve, held it tight
		between thumb and forefinger as he reached for the cup. Smooth motions, deft, I must not fumble now, he prayed, and the
		gods were kind. In the blink of an eye, his fingers were empty. His hands had not been so steady for years, nor half so
		fluid. Davos saw, but no one else, he was certain. Cup in hand, he rose to his feet. "Mayhaps I have been a fool. Lady
		Melisandre, will you share a cup of wine with me? A cup in honor of your god, your Lord of Light? A cup to toast his
		power? "
		The red woman studied him. "If you wish."
		He could feel them all watching him. Davos clutched at him as he left the bench, catching his sleeve with the fingers
		that Lord Stannis had shortened. "What are you doing?" he whispered.
		"A thing that must be done," Maester Cressen answered, "for the sake of the realm, and the soul of my lord." He
		shook off Davos’s hand, spilling a drop of wine on the rushes.
		She met him beneath the high table with every man’s eyes upon them. But Cressen saw only her. Red silk, red eyes, the
		ruby red at her throat, red lips curled in a faint smile as she put her hand atop his own, around the cup. Her skin felt
		hot, feverish. "It is not too late to spill the wine, Maester."
