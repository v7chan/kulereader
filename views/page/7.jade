    #[span.name.catelyn Catelyn] had never liked this godswood. She had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red
    Fork of the Trident. The godswood there was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled
    shadows across tinkling streams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of
    flowers. The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old
    forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and
    decay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of
    mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close together while
    twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil. This was a place
    of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no names. But she knew she would find
    her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man's life, afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood.
    #[span.name.catelyn Catelyn] had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of
    Riverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had names,
    and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents. Worship was a septon with a censer, the smell of
    incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices raised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the
    great houses did, but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept. For her
    sake, #[span.name.ned Ned] had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of the First
    Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods
    of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest. At the center of the grove an ancient
    weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold. #[span.name.ned "The heart tree," Ned] called it. The
    weirwood's bark was white as bone, its leaves dark red, like a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been
    carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap
    and strangely watchful. They were old, those eyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the
    Builder set the first stone, if the tales were true; they had watched the castle's granite walls rise around
    them. It was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries
    before the coming of the First Men across the narrow sea. In the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or
    burned out a thousand years ago, except on the Isle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up
    here it was different. Here every castle had its godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every
    heart tree its face. #[span.name.catelyn Catelyn] found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The
    greatsword Ice was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night.
